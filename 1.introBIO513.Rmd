# Outline

This lecture will provide an introduction in the data types and analysis for genomics.
The advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms has resulted in large volumes of data being produced. It important to know how to manage and interpret this data in a reproducible way.

This lecture will cover the following aspects:

1. Sequence data and databases

- Common sequence data file formats (e.g. `.fastq`, `.fasta`, `.bam`, `fast5`)
- What data is contained in files and how to interpret information
- Databases and online resources for genomics
    - How to navigate online NCBI resources, in particular how to interpret output from nucleotide BLAST searches.

2. Tools for analyzing data

- Tools to query, inspect, visualize sequence files
- Demultiplexing, merging, trimming and quality filtering
- Discuss methods of assembly/clustering in the different contexts of sequence data
    - Amplicon sequencing (clustering/denoising into taxonomic units)
    - Shotgun sequencing (assembling contigs and scaffolds)
- Be familar with both Unix shell and R environment (inc. packages) for sequence data


<!--
In this lecture we will cover data file formats including:`.fastq`, `.fasta`, `.bam`, `fast5`.
We will discuss how they relate to the various sequence platforms and what information they provide.
The lecture will then discuss the following aspects

Assess sequence quality
Map sequence data onto a reference genome
Perform de novo assembly tasks
Quantify sequence data
Integrate biological context with sequence information

1.Sequence data
- Databases and online resources for sequence data
- Learn the common sequence data file formats
- Learn the common sequence data file formats
2.Tools for sequencing data
- Tools to query, inspect, visualize an aligned sequence file
- Learn the contents of sequence data files
- Learn to generate sequencing metrics and to process sequence data
- Learn about Python and R libraries/packages to read sequence data
